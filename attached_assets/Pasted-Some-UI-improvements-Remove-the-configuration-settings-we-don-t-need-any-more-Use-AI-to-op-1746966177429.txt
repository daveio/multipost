Some UI improvements:

- Remove the configuration settings we don't need any more:
  - `Use AI to optimize for each platform`
  - `Auto-split long posts with AI`
- Remove 'optimize with AI'. We have a different flow for splitting now.
  - I still want to see the 'split with AI' button when needed.
- When the splitting has been completed, the main post page doesn't have any UI support for a thread of multiple posts.
  - It only displays the first post in the thread.
  - Add support for manual threading, and the output of splitting.
    - Add another text box when I hit the character limit to allow me to manually thread if I don't want to use AI.
- Remove the 'thread-optimized' splitting mode.
  - Always thread optimize.
  - Use the syntax of two newlines, then a ðŸ§µ emoji, then `x of y` where `x` is the post number and `y` is the number of posts in the thread.
  - Disable `Use thread notation (ðŸ§µ x/y)` when AI has added threading syntax.
    - Replace it with `Use thread notation (ðŸ§µ x of y)` to match our new format. Remember to add two newlines before the emoji and count.
- Improve the multi-strategy selector for AI splitting strategies
  - The current description of the strategies doesn't change when the strategies change
    - It always says `Splits by semantic units, preserving complete thoughts and topics.`
  - Use tooltips explaining each AI splitting strategy, which are always displayed and not only on hover
  - Add general improvements
- Create an elegant loading animation for long-running AI operations
  - Improve the progress indicator for AI post splitting to show real-time processing steps
  - Maybe show the JSON received at each stage - it won't be useful, but it might be aesthetically pleasing
- Develop a 'Save Splitting Configurations' feature for quick reuse
  - Also add a 'Reset Splitting Configurations' feature for quick reset to defaults
- Add a dark mode
  - Add a toggle to switch between light, dark, and system mode
  - Add a button to reset the theme to the default
  - Load the theme settings from `localStorage`
  - Save the theme settings to `localStorage`
  - Default to dark mode
