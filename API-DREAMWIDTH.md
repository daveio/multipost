# Dreamwidth API Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how Multipost can integrate with Dreamwidth, a blog-hosting platform built on an open-source fork of the LiveJournal codebase. Dreamwidth maintains much of LiveJournal's API architecture while adding its own improvements and community features.

## API Architecture

Dreamwidth's API is primarily based on the LiveJournal XML-RPC API with some modifications:

- **XML-RPC Protocol**: Core method of interacting with the platform
- **REST-like endpoints**: For specific functionality (limited documentation)
- **Client-server model**: Authentication required for most operations

## Authentication Methods

Dreamwidth supports two primary authentication methods:

1. **Standard Authentication**
   - Username/password authentication using plaintext or challenge/response
   - Less secure but widely supported
   - Should be used only over HTTPS connections

2. **OAuth Authentication** (Limited Documentation)
   - May be available for some operations
   - Implementation details are sparse in public documentation
   - More secure than standard authentication

## Core API Capabilities

The Dreamwidth API enables Multipost to:

- Create and publish blog posts
- Format text with HTML and Dreamwidth-specific markup
- Upload and attach images
- Manage post privacy levels
- Set tags and categories
- Create and manage comment threads

## Implementation Strategy

For Multipost, we recommend implementing Dreamwidth integration using the following approach:

1. **Authentication**: Implement standard authentication over HTTPS
2. **Post Creation**: Support text formatting with HTML and Dreamwidth markup
3. **Privacy Controls**: Implement Dreamwidth's various privacy levels
4. **Media Handling**: Support image uploads and embedding
5. **Content Adaptation**: Format content appropriately for blog-style presentation

## Client Libraries

There are limited modern client libraries specifically for Dreamwidth, but these may be useful:

- **LJRuby**: Ruby gem for LiveJournal API that may be adaptable for Dreamwidth
- **XML-RPC Gems**: Generic XML-RPC libraries for Ruby can be used (`xmlrpc` gem)
- **Custom Implementation**: Direct implementation of the XML-RPC protocol

## Rate Limits and Constraints

- **Post Length**: Virtually unlimited text length
- **Media Attachments**: Multiple images supported
- **Rate Limiting**: Specific limits not well documented, but likely present
- **Content Formatting**: Supports HTML and Dreamwidth-specific markup

## Best Practices

1. **Use HTTPS for All Communications**: Especially important for authentication
2. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: XML-RPC errors can be cryptic
3. **Respect User Privacy Settings**: Dreamwidth has strong privacy features
4. **Cache Authentication Tokens**: Minimize authentication requests
5. **Handle Markup Conversion**: Convert Markdown or other formats to Dreamwidth's supported formats

## Testing Approach

Since Dreamwidth is open source, it may be possible to:

- Set up a test instance for development
- Use a test account on the live service
- Implement mock responses for integration tests

## Development Resources

- [Dreamwidth Open Source Repository](https://github.com/dreamwidth/dreamwidth)
- [LiveJournal XML-RPC API Documentation](https://www.livejournal.com/doc/server/ljp.csp.xml-rpc.protocol.html) (similar to Dreamwidth)
- [Dreamwidth Developer Community](https://dw-dev.dreamwidth.org/) (may contain additional resources)

## Implementation Notes

- The API is primarily XML-RPC based, which isn't as common in modern web services
- Documentation can be sparse or outdated
- Consider reaching out to the Dreamwidth developer community for current best practices
- The platform is Perl-based, which may influence API design and behavior

## Future Considerations

- Dreamwidth occasionally updates its API capabilities
- As an open source project, community contributions may add new features
- Watch for potential transition to more modern API patterns in the future
