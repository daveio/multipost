# FetLife API Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how Multipost can potentially integrate with FetLife, a social networking platform for the BDSM, fetish, and kink communities. It's important to note that as of our research, FetLife does not offer an official public API for developers. This guide covers potential approaches for integration based on community-developed unofficial methods.

## API Status

- **No Official API**: FetLife does not currently provide an official documented API for third-party developers
- **Unofficial Approaches**: Several community-created libraries exist that implement scraping or reverse-engineered approaches
- **Limited Functionality**: Most unofficial methods focus on read operations rather than content posting

## Potential Integration Methods

Without an official API, integration options are limited but might include:

1. **Web Scraping Approach**
   - Programmatically interact with the web interface
   - Subject to frequent breakage due to UI changes
   - Ethical and Terms of Service considerations apply

2. **Unofficial API Libraries**
   - Several community-created libraries exist
   - Implementations in PHP, Node.js, .NET, and other languages
   - No guarantee of stability or continued functionality

3. **Browser Automation**
   - Using tools like Selenium or Puppeteer
   - Simulates user interaction with the web interface
   - More resilient to minor UI changes than direct scraping

## Authentication Approaches

Based on unofficial libraries, authentication typically involves:

- Standard username/password authentication
- Session management via cookies
- Potential CAPTCHA or anti-automation measures
- No OAuth or API key support

## Potential Capabilities

If implemented through unofficial means, the following capabilities might be possible:

- Creating text posts in a user's feed
- Uploading images (with appropriate content warnings)
- Posting to groups or fetish-specific forums
- Sending private messages
- Managing friend connections

## Implementation Considerations

If pursuing an unofficial integration, consider:

1. **Terms of Service Compliance**
   - Review FetLife's Terms of Service regarding automated access
   - Be respectful of the platform's community guidelines
   - Consider rate limiting to avoid overloading the service

2. **User Privacy and Consent**
   - Ensure users understand the limitations of unofficial integration
   - Obtain explicit consent for actions performed on their behalf
   - Handle credentials with appropriate security measures

3. **Stability Management**
   - Implement robust error handling
   - Develop monitoring for integration breakage
   - Plan for regular updates as the website changes

## Available Unofficial Libraries

Several community-developed libraries exist but may not be maintained:

- **libFetLife**: PHP library for FetLife interactions
- **fetlife-api-client**: Node.js client for FetLife
- **FetLife.NET**: C# implementation for .NET applications

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Before implementing any unofficial integration, consider:

- FetLife's Terms of Service may prohibit automated access
- Content on FetLife is often sensitive and requires appropriate handling
- User consent and privacy are particularly important given the nature of the platform

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of direct API integration, consider:

1. **Manual Sharing Option**
   - Provide users with formatted content to copy-paste
   - Include instructions for manual posting
   - No programmatic integration required

2. **Browser Extension**
   - Develop a browser extension that assists users with cross-posting
   - Operates in the user's browser context
   - May be more compliant with Terms of Service

## Development Resources

- [FetLife Website](https://fetlife.com)
- [libFetLife GitHub Repository](https://github.com/fabacab/libFetLife)
- Web scraping libraries for Ruby (Nokogiri, Mechanize)
- Browser automation tools (Selenium, Puppeteer, Capybara)

## Implementation Notes

- No official support channel exists for API-related questions
- Any integration would be unofficial and potentially subject to breakage
- User education about the limitations is essential

## Future Possibilities

- FetLife may introduce an official API in the future
- Community standards and site policies may evolve
- Alternative platforms with official APIs may emerge in this space

## Recommendations

Given the lack of an official API, we recommend:

1. Consider FetLife integration as an experimental feature
2. Prioritize platforms with official APIs
3. If implemented, clearly communicate the unofficial nature to users
4. Monitor closely for changes to the platform that might affect integration
