# Multipost Prompt

Develop the frontend for a web application based on the provided specifications. The design should prioritize visual appeal and user experience, with a focus on real-time feedback mechanisms, particularly for character counts in the post entry field. Optimize the application for desktop environments while ensuring full responsiveness for mobile devices. Implement a mock backend that simulates GraphQL and JSON responses to facilitate development and testing before the actual backend is available. The real backend will also speak GraphQL and JSON. The application should be configurable to switch between the mock backend and the real backend when it becomes available.
