### OpenAI Service

The `openaiService.ts` handles AI-powered post splitting and optimization.

#### Main Functions:

- **splitPost**: Splits a post into multiple posts based on selected strategies
- **generateSplittingOptions**: Generates different splitting options
- **optimizePost**: Optimizes a post for a specific platform

## AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model to split and optimize content:

1. When a post exceeds character limits, the user can click "Split with AI"
2. Multiple splitting strategies can be selected simultaneously:
   - Semantic splitting (keeping related content together)
   - Sentence splitting (at natural sentence boundaries)
   - Hashtag retention (keeping hashtags intact)
   - Mention preservation (ensuring @mentions stay together)
3. The AI considers all selected strategies together rather than applying them individually
4. Thread optimization is included in all strategies by default
5. The AI provides reasoning for its splits which can be displayed to the user
6. Multiple splitting options can be saved and loaded

### OpenAI API Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4o model for several key features:

1. **API Key Management**:
   - The application checks for the presence of the OpenAI API key at server startup
   - Key validation happens before making API requests
   - Detailed error messages for missing or invalid keys

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for OpenAI API responses
   - User-friendly error messages with suggestions for resolution
   - Specific handling for common errors (rate limits, quota exceeded)
   - Detailed error logging for debugging

3. **GPT-4o Prompt Engineering**:
   - Structured system prompts that combine multiple splitting strategies
   - JSON response formatting for consistent parsing
   - Thread optimization instructions built into every prompt
   - Character limit enforcement based on platform requirements
 
4. **Response Validation**:
   - Safety checks for malformed API responses
   - Thread indicator format validation to ensure two newlines before thread markers
   - Automatic correction of improperly formatted thread indicators
   - Handling for unexpected response formats
   - Fallback mechanisms for failed requests
   - Structured error propagation to client

## State Management

Post form state is managed through the `usePostForm` hook, which handles:

1. Content updates
2. Platform selection
3. Media file uploads
4. Draft saving/loading
5. Post submission
6. Advanced options
7. Thread management

Local storage is used to persist:
- Advanced options
- Custom character limits
- Splitting configurations
- Thread state

## Thread Management

Thread creation and management is handled through:

1. **ThreadPostsManager**: UI component for thread navigation and editing
2. **usePostForm.setupThread**: Converts a single post into a thread
3. **Thread State**: Maintained in both component state and localStorage
4. **Event Handling**: All thread-related buttons use proper event handling to prevent form submission

Thread functionality includes:
- Creating threads from scratch
- Converting long posts into threads using AI
- Adding/removing thread posts
- Navigating between posts
- Previewing complete threads
- Exiting thread mode safely

### Thread Formatting Standard

Thread indicators follow a consistent formatting rule to ensure readability:

- Thread indicators (like "🧵 2 of 3") are always preceded by two newlines
- This ensures clear visual separation between post content and thread indicators
- This formatting is applied automatically whether using manual thread creation or AI-based splitting
- Example of proper thread formatting:
  ```
  Blake's 7 featured early representation with diverse casting and strong female characters. Its finale is one of TV's most shocking. Available on streaming platforms—give it three episodes. Fair warning: don't get attached to anyone.

  🧵 2 of 3
  ```

## Installation & Setup

export const DEFAULT_PLATFORMS: Platform[] = [
  {
    id: 'bluesky',
    isSelected: true,
  },
  {
    id: 'mastodon',
    isSelected: true,
  },
  {
    id: 'threads',
    isSelected: true,
  }
];

export const PLATFORM_CHARACTER_LIMITS: Record<string, number> = {
  bluesky: 300,

## Theming

The application features a comprehensive theming system based on the Catppuccin color palette:

### Catppuccin Theme Framework

The Catppuccin theme framework provides a cohesive and visually pleasing appearance with four distinct theme flavors:

1. **Latte** - Light theme with soft, warm colors
2. **Frappé** - Dark theme with medium contrast (default)
3. **Macchiato** - Dark theme with higher contrast
4. **Mocha** - Dark theme with rich, saturated colors

### Theme Implementation Details

- **Default Theme**: The application defaults to the Frappé theme (dark mode)
- **Theme Selection**: Users can switch between themes using the theme selector in the header
- **Theme Categories**: Themes are organized into Light (Latte) and Dark (Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha) categories
- **Persistence**: Selected theme preference is saved to localStorage
- **System Preference**: On first visit, the theme will respect the user's system preference (dark/light)

### Theme Architecture

- **CatppuccinThemeProvider**: Context provider that manages theme state and localStorage persistence
- **useCatppuccinTheme**: Custom hook to access current theme and theme-switching functions
- **Theme Variables**: CSS variables defined in `tailwind.config.ts` connected to Catppuccin color values
- **Theme-Aware Components**: UI components that adapt their appearance based on the active theme

### Color Palette Integration

- **Social Icons**: Platform icons adapt colors based on theme for optimal visibility
- **Platform Cards**: Backgrounds and text colors adjust based on theme
- **UI Elements**: All interface elements use theme-aware color variables
- **Contrast Optimization**: Text and background colors are carefully paired to maintain readability

### Theme Customization

The theme implementation uses Tailwind CSS and CSS variables, allowing for:

1. **Consistent Styling**: All components share the same color definitions
2. **Easy Extensibility**: New components automatically inherit theme colors
3. **Accessibility**: Color contrasts meet WCAG guidelines across all themes
4. **Performance**: Theme switching happens without page reloads

   - Event propagation control (preventDefault, stopPropagation)

## Design Decisions

### UI Design Philosophy

Multipost's UI design follows several key principles:

1. **Focus on Content Creation**: The main post composer is centrally positioned and takes visual priority, allowing users to focus on their content without distractions.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features are accessible but not overwhelming. For example, AI splitting options appear only when relevant (when content exceeds platform limits).

3. **Platform-Specific Contextual Information**: Character counters and platform previews provide immediate feedback on how content will appear on each platform.

4. **Consistent Visual Language**: The Catppuccin color palette ensures visual consistency throughout the application, with careful attention to contrast and accessibility.

    D --> M[Platform-Specific Previews]
    
    E --> N[Catppuccin Theme]
    E --> O[Consistent Component Styles]
    E --> P[Responsive Layouts]
```

### Why Theme-Aware Components?

The decision to implement theme-aware components was made to:

1. **Enhance User Experience**: Different users have different preferences for light vs. dark themes. By supporting both and defaulting to the user's system preference, the application feels more native and personalized.

2. **Reduce Eye Strain**: Dark themes (Frappé, Macchiato, Mocha) reduce eye strain in low-light environments, while the light theme (Latte) works better in bright environments.

3. **Brand Consistency**: The Catppuccin palette provides a cohesive look across all aspects of the application while allowing for theme variety.

4. **Technical Implementation**: Using CSS variables and Tailwind's theme extension mechanism allows for theme switching without page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Component Design Decisions

Each major component was designed with specific goals in mind:

1. **PostComposer**:
   - **Why a central textarea?** Provides a familiar, distraction-free writing experience.
   - **Why platform toggles?** Allows users to selectively target specific platforms while seeing immediate feedback on character limits.
   - **Why a tabbed preview?** Enables users to see how their post will look on each platform without cluttering the UI.

2. **ThreadPostsManager**:
   - **Why a numbered navigation?** Makes it easy to see the sequence and navigate between posts in a thread.
   - **Why inline addition/removal?** Provides immediate control over thread structure without modal dialogs that would interrupt workflow.

3. **AISplitPreview**:
   - **Why show multiple strategies?** Different content types benefit from different splitting approaches, and user preferences vary.
   - **Why show reasoning?** Transparency in AI decisions builds trust and helps users understand why certain splits were made.
   - **Why allow strategy combination?** Complex posts may benefit from multiple strategies applied simultaneously, providing more nuanced results.

## Performance Considerations

The application was built with performance in mind:

### Frontend Performance

1. **React Query Caching**: API responses are cached to minimize redundant network requests. This improves perceived performance, especially when navigating between views.

   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       A[User Action] --> B{Cached?}
       B -->|Yes| C[Use Cached Data]
       B -->|No| D[Fetch New Data]
       D --> E[Update Cache]
       C --> F[Render UI]
       E --> F
   ```

2. **Lazy Loading**: Components that aren't immediately needed are lazy-loaded to reduce initial bundle size and improve time-to-interactive.

3. **Debouncing**: Content updates are debounced to prevent excessive re-renders and API calls during rapid typing.

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[User Types] --> B[Debounce]
       B --> C{500ms Passed?}
       C -->|No| D[Wait]
       C -->|Yes| E[Process Update]
       D --> C
   ```

4. **Optimized Re-renders**: Components use React.memo and careful state management to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### Backend Performance

1. **Efficient OpenAI Requests**: The application optimizes OpenAI API usage by:
   - Sending only necessary context in prompts
   - Using the most appropriate model settings
   - Implementing request batching when appropriate
   - Reusing response data when possible

2. **Memory Optimization**: The in-memory storage is designed to minimize memory usage while maintaining quick access patterns.

3. **Response Compression**: The Express server uses compression middleware to reduce network payload sizes.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

The application includes comprehensive testing to ensure reliability:
