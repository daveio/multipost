# Bluesky Integration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how Multipost integrates with Bluesky, a decentralized social network built on the AT Protocol (ATP). Bluesky offers unique capabilities for content sharing due to its decentralized architecture and strong data portability features.

## AT Protocol Architecture

The AT Protocol (ATP) is the foundational technology behind Bluesky with these key characteristics:

- **Decentralized data model**: Each user has a personal data repository
- **Repository-based**: User data stored in personal "at://" repositories
- **Custom schemas**: Applications can define custom record types via Lexicon
- **Real-time sync**: Network "firehose" for data synchronization

## Authentication Methods

Bluesky supports two primary authentication methods:

1. **OAuth Authentication** (Recommended)
   - Requires user consent for repository access
   - Generates session tokens for API interactions
   - Most secure for third-party applications

2. **App Password Authentication** (Legacy)
   - Direct login with user credentials
   - Less secure but simpler implementation
   - Being phased out in favor of OAuth

## Core API Capabilities

The Bluesky API enables Multipost to:

- Create and publish posts
- Upload media attachments
- Format rich text with mentions and links
- Manage content visibility
- Track engagement metrics
- Handle user profiles and settings

## Implementation Strategy

For Multipost, we'll implement Bluesky integration using the following approach:

1. **Authentication**: Implement OAuth flow for secure user authorization
2. **Post Creation**: Support text formatting, mentions, and media uploads
3. **Thread Support**: Enable multi-post thread creation and management
4. **Content Optimization**: Adapt content for Bluesky's specific features
5. **Engagement Tracking**: Monitor interactions with published content

## Client Libraries

Several client libraries are available for Bluesky integration:

- **Official TypeScript API**: `@atproto/api` - Comprehensive TypeScript client
- **Indigo**: Collection of Go-based tools for ATP integration
- **Goat CLI**: Command-line tool for AT Protocol interaction, useful for testing

## Rate Limits and Constraints

- **Post Length**: 300 Unicode characters per post
- **Media Attachments**: Up to 4 images per post
- **Rate Limiting**: API calls are subject to rate limiting (specific limits TBD)
- **Content Filtering**: Support for content labeling and moderation

## Best Practices

1. **Use OAuth Authentication**: More secure and future-proof
2. **Implement Rich Text Handling**: Proper formatting of mentions and links
3. **Apply Optimistic Updates**: For responsive user experience
4. **Handle Network Delays**: Account for eventual consistency in the network
5. **Support Content Moderation**: Respect user preferences for content filtering

## Testing Tools

The Goat CLI (`github.com/bluesky-social/indigo/cmd/goat`) provides useful capabilities for testing Bluesky integration:

- Resolve account identities
- Explore repositories
- Analyze network events
- Post test content
- Monitor the firehose
